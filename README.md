<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

"Create a connection, with a little liquid courage."

OnMe is a cross-platform mobile app dedicated to the lonely residents of Metro Vancouver. It allows the user to order anyone inside the current restaurant a food or drink item based on their table and seat number.

It was created by D3 BCIT students as our 3rd semester final project. The proof of concept was presented to 200 people, including students, faculty, and industry experts.
